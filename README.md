# Farmer Bankruptcy Data

This repository is meant as a way to disseminate data related to bankruptcies in the United States with a specific focus on farmer bankruptcies -- usually referred to as chapter 12. Chapter 12 was enacted in 1986 as a response to the 1980s farm crisis and it went into effect on November 26, 1986.

The data are at differing levels of observation with National and District level data available annually since the passage of Chapter 12. In 1995, these National and District level data are available at the quarterly level. And in 2007, the data are available at the monthly level onward.

County level data are available annually from 1990 onward and quarterly from September 2008 onward. County level data is generally problematic for bankruptcies because the listed county is for the residence of the bankruptcy filer and this may not correspond to where a business operates. For farmers, we do not find this to be a major issue as a filer of chapter 12 must be active in farming and most farmers will reside at or near their farming operation.
